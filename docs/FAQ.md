# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I contribute?

Welcome to the world of command line AI. You can contribute in any form, inlcuding adding new features, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or writing new tutorials, and of course, making new skills to add to the CLAI catalog. Please check [here](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on contributing code. Also, check out our [Slack](http://ibm.biz/clai-slack) community and join in on the fun!

## What data is being saved?

If you agree to contribute your data during the installation process (optional) we will store 1) statistics on which skills you use; and 2) the `State` and `Action` information outlined [here](../clai/server/plugins/). This will help us improve over time. The data from (2) can be used to train learning agents such as the one outlined [here](../clai/server/orchestration/patterns/bandit_orchestrator/) and may be made available in anonymized form for the community to use as training data. Individual skills do no store any data, unless otherwise mentioned explicitly while they are being installed.
